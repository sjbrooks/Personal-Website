          <h1>ABOUT</h1>
          <p>I’m Sarah, a brand consultant turned programmer.</p> <span>(Also an animal-lover, pasta enthusiast, and jump-roper.)</span>
          <p>I’ve been interested in coding since I was 10, when I taught myself enough to create a blog. Since then, I’ve taken several programming classes in college and taught myself Javascript on the side.</p>
          <p>I started my career in brand strategy consulting, where, among other projects, I got to build a lifestyle brand for the US Women's National Team, conduct consumer research in Chile, and reposition a big software company in the Bay Area. I learned how to break problems into their component parts, structure my thinking, and persuade others, but I always found myself wanting to spend more time learning how the things I was branding worked – from peripheral catheters to design software.</p>
          <p>From that came a reinvigorated interest in engineering, and specifically coding, as a means of understanding how things we interact with every day are built.</p>
          <p>Last summer, I decided to make a career change based on that interest, and I’ve been coding daily since. My goals coming out of this bootcamp are to take a software engineering role where I can learn best practices, (incrementally) broaden representation of women in tech, and eventually use my skills for social impact.

          <a href="Memory-Card-Game/memory-card-game.html"><h2>MEMORY CARD GAME</h2></a>
          <p>Card-based memory game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (without frameworks/third-party libraries). Players are shown a collection of cards, face down, and can click on a card to reveal what’s underneath. Players can click up to two cards at once, at which point the game checks to see whether they match. If they do, they remain face up; Otherwise, they remain displayed for a second before flipping back down. The goal of the game is to match up pairs of cards in as few attempts as possible. The game displays the number of attempts of the current game and best game, and allows the user to reset the game (and reshuffle the cards) at any time.</p>

        <a href="Meme-Generator/meme-generator.html"><h2>MEME GENERATOR</h2></a>
        <p>Meme generator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (without frameworks/third-party libraries). The page consists of a form that accepts a link to an image, text for the top of the meme, and text for the bottom of the meme. When the user submits the form, it uses JavaScript to append to the DOM a div which contains the meme, including the image and its text. User can add multiple memes to the page by submitting the form multiple times, click on a button to remove a meme from the page. The form is reset after each meme is generated.</p>
