        <p class="maintext">I’m Sarah, a brand consultant turned programmer. 
        <br>
        (Also an animal-lover, pasta enthusiast, and jump-roper.)</p>
        
        <p class="maintext">I’ve been interested in coding since I was 10, when I taught myself enough to create a blog. Since then, I’ve taken several programming classes in college and taught myself Javascript on the side.</p>
        
        <p class="maintext">I started my career in brand strategy consulting, where, among other projects, I got to build a lifestyle brand for the US Women's National Team, conduct consumer research in Chile, and reposition a big software company in the Bay Area. I learned how to break problems into their component parts, structure my thinking, and persuade others, but I always found myself wanting to spend more time learning how the things I was branding worked – from peripheral catheters to design software.</p>
        
        <p class="maintext">From that came a reinvigorated interest in engineering, and specifically coding, as a means of understanding how things we interact with every day are built.</p>

        <p class="maintext">Last summer, I decided to make a career change based on that interest, and I’ve been coding daily since. My goals coming out of this bootcamp are to take a software engineering role where I can learn best practices, (incrementally) broaden representation of women in tech, and eventually use my skills for social impact.
